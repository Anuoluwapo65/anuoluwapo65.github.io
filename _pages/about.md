Currently, I’m a second-year undergraduate student in the Faculty of Dentistry at
[Obafemi Awolowo University](https://oauife.edu.ng/). My research interests lies in the field of
**computer vision** and **multimodal representation learning**, with an emphasis on
**foundation model pretraining** for computational pathology and dental imaging.

My long-term goal is to design scalable, self-supervised multimodal models (vision–language models)
that effectively model and interpret biomedical data — including oral histopathology,
oral radiology (2D and 3D), and surgical video understanding — for clinically meaningful
applications in oral and maxillofacial medicine.

My research interest lies in :

- Pretraining **foundation models** for computational pathology (Oral pathology) and Oral Radiology(2D & 3D)
- **Multi-instance learning** for Whole Sliding imaging
- Developing Multimodal learning models for Dental imaging interpretation: **CBCT, CT, MRI, Panaromic, Intra-oral**
- Video understanding for surgical procedures
